[map plot](https://star732.github.io/UW_Madison_STAT679/Calfresh_Enrollment/Maps/map_plot.html)

- create a choropleth map of California, shaded in by the average enrollment for that county over the full time window of the dataset.

[combined plot](https://star732.github.io/UW_Madison_STAT679/Calfresh_Enrollment/Combined/calfresh_enrollment_combined_plot.html)

- create previous choropleth map of California on the same page of line plot

[Interactive plot](https://star732.github.io/UW_Madison_STAT679/Calfresh_Enrollment/Interactive/interactive_calfresh.html)

- A simple interactive plot. When user's mouse hover on one county of California, line plot will change to the plot displaying tendency of enrollment corresponding to the specific county.
